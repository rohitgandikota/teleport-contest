# Working notes

Things discovered while doing the work that are not obvious from reading the
contest docs, and that would cost the next agent time to rediscover.

**Add to this file whenever you learn something non-obvious.** Edit the existing
entry if one covers the same ground rather than appending a duplicate. Keep each

## Scoring: what the runner actually does

Read from `frozen/ps_test_runner.mjs`, which is the same runner the judge uses.

**Cursor position is part of the screen score, not a tiebreaker.**
`docs/API.md` says cursors are "scored as a tiebreaker only". That is stale. The
runner counts a screen as matched only when the cell grid **and** the cursor both
agree (`ps_test_runner.mjs:371-377`), and `/README.md` agrees: "character + color
+ attribute + cursor position". A perfectly rendered screen with the cursor one
column off scores zero for that step. Port the cursor choreography, do not defer
it.

The runner does report `cellsOnly` and `cursors` sub-counts separately in its
JSON, and prints them on the FAIL line when they disagree — useful for triage.

**`runSegment` is called with one argument.** `docs/API.md` documents
`runSegment(input, prevGame = null)`, but the runner calls `runSegment(input)`
with no second argument (`ps_test_runner.mjs:337`). Do not rely on `prevGame`
carrying anything between segments. All cross-segment state must round-trip
through `input.storage`. This matters for every multi-segment session.

**RNG "matched" is a positional count, not a prefix length.** The runner counts
every index where our call equals C's (`ps_test_runner.mjs:357-359`). After a
divergence, later calls can coincidentally realign, so a high RNG percentage can
hide an early break. `tools/diverge.mjs` prints both the positional count and the
index of the first divergence — trust the first-divergence index.

**Per-session local timeout is 45 s**, from `SESSION_REPLAY_TIMEOUT_MS`
(`ps_test_runner.mjs:461`). The judge allows 900 s. So a session can pass the
judge's clock and still time out locally. Raise the env var rather than
optimising prematurely.

**The scorer writes `.cache/session-results.json`** with the full JSON bundle
after every run, so tooling can read the last score without re-running.

**The fork's CI overlays only two of the three frozen files.**
`.github/workflows/score.yml` copies `frozen/isaac64.js` and
`frozen/terminal.js` over `js/`, but not `frozen/storage.js`, even though
`docs/API.md` lists all three as frozen and overlaid by the judge. So a local
edit to `js/storage.js` would pass CI and fail the judge. Do not edit it.

## The recorder

**`make install` does not install `sysconf`, and without it the recorder exits
before the first frame.**
The binary is built with `SYSCF` enabled (`include/config.h:232-234` defines
`SYSCF` and `SYSCF_FILE "sysconf"`), so `cfgfiles.c:2052` opens `sysconf`
relative to HACKDIR and calls `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)` if it is missing.
`SYSCONFINSTALL` is commented out in `sys/unix/Makefile.top:110-119` and no
minimal hints file defines it, so nothing ever creates the file.

The failure is silent in the worst way: `scripts/record-session.mjs` reports
`[ok] wrote …` and produces a session with the right number of segments and
**zero steps**. `scripts/verify-rerecord.mjs` then reports `FAIL: seg 0 steps len
N vs 0` for all 44 sessions, which reads like a recorder determinism problem
rather than a missing file.

Fixed permanently in `nethack-c/build-recorder.sh` (step 6). If you rebuild by
hand, the install dir needs a `sysconf`.

**The stock `sysconf` template breaks on macOS.** It sets
`GDBPATH=/usr/bin/gdb` and `GREPPATH=/bin/grep`; NetHack refuses to start when
those name files that do not exist, and prints `2 errors in sysconf.` as its
first screen. Strip `GDBPATH`, `GREPPATH`, `PANICTRACE_GDB`, and
`PANICTRACE_LIBC` — they only affect crash handling. The build script does this.

**Debug-mode sessions need `WIZARDS=*` in sysconf.** 13 of the 44 public
sessions set `playmode:debug` in their nethackrc. NetHack honours that only for a
user listed in the sysconf `WIZARDS` line; the stock template says
`WIZARDS=root games`, so an ordinary user is **silently demoted to normal play**.
There is no warning — you get a complete, valid, entirely different game, with
different attributes and a different level. The tell is the status line: a
debug-mode game shows the player name as `wizard` regardless of the rc `name:`,
so canonical `Wizard the Digger` re-recording as `Magellan the Digger` means the
demotion happened. The build script now writes `WIZARDS=*`.

**Debug mode forces the player name to `wizard`,** which means every debug-mode
segment shares one lock file (`<uid>wizard.0`) no matter what the characters are
named. Combined with the next entry, this is what broke the one remaining
multi-segment session.

**Abandoned in-progress games leak a lock into the next segment.** When a
segment's `moves` run out mid-death-sequence, the driver SIGTERMs the recorder
before NetHack unlinks its lock file, and the next segment opens on `There is
already a game in progress under your name. Destroy old game? [yn]` instead of
the recorded first frame — one step, then nothing.
`scripts/record-session.mjs` deliberately does not wipe state between segments
(a save/restore pair needs the save file), so this needed a narrower fix:
`clearAbandonedGame()` removes lock and per-level files (`*.<n>`) between
segments **only when `save/` is empty**, preserving bones, the scoreboard, and
genuine save/restore pairs. Hit by `seed5002-wizard-coverage-pair`.

**With all of the above, the recorder is bit-exact on the whole corpus:
`node scripts/verify-rerecord.mjs` reports 44/44 pass.** No normalisation is
needed for most sessions; `verify-rerecord.mjs` elides only the build-date
banner and the rc home path.

Recording is fast: a 23-step session re-records in well under a second, and all
44 sessions re-record in a couple of minutes.

## Session file format

`sessions/*.session.json`, version 5:

```
{ version, source, recorded_with, segments: [ { seed, datetime, nethackrc, moves, steps } ] }
```

Each step is `{ key, rng, screen, cursor }`, plus `depth` after the first and
`animation_frames` where animation fired. `key` is `null` on step 0 (the frame
before any input). `cursor` is `[col, row, visible]`.

RNG entries carry the caller annotation the scorer strips:

```
rn2(2)=0 @ randomize_gem_colors(o_init.c:89)
```

That annotation is the single most useful debugging asset in the repo — it names
the exact C source line that made each call. `tools/diverge.mjs` uses it to name
the next function to port.

Screens use `\n` line separators, `\x1b[NC` cursor-forward runs, SGR colour
escapes, and `\x0e`/`\x0f` to enter and leave DEC line-drawing mode.

The corpus is 51 MB across 44 files. Never read one whole; query with `node -e`.

## Lua is on the critical path, not a late-game concern

Measured with `tools/coverage-map.mjs` over the 44 public sessions.

- `src/sp_lev.c` executes in **44/44** sessions, 97,479 PRNG calls. Its hottest
  functions are `create_room` (32,170), `get_location` (26,830), and
  `dig_corridor` (23,570) — those are *ordinary* level generation, not special
  levels.
- **Every** session makes Lua-context PRNG calls, tagged `@ nh.rn2()` by recorder
  patch 004. The floor is 210 calls, in the shortest 25-step sessions. Total
  23,671 calls, 3.0% of the corpus.
- Exactly **one** Lua binding draws randomness: `nh.rn2`. Nothing else. So the
  randomness surface of the Lua layer is tiny — it is the script *execution
  order* that has to be reproduced, not a wide API.
- `lspo_*` opcodes appear (`lspo_replace_terrain` 4,597, `lspo_map` 368,
  `lspo_gold` 29). Those are called *from* Lua scripts, confirming scripts really
  are running on ordinary levels.
- `flip_level_rnd` appears (128 calls), so the 5.0 mirrored-level feature fires
  in the public corpus.

Conclusion: level 1 of every game runs Lua, almost certainly via themed rooms
(`themerms.lua`, `nhcore.lua`, `nhlib.lua`). M9 was split into M9a (Lua core,
prerequisite of M4) and M9b (named special levels and quests) as a result.

## The RNG log format, precisely

From `nethack-c/patches/003-rng-log-core.patch` and verified against the
recordings. Getting this wrong desynchronises the whole log, so it is worth
knowing exactly.

- **Six entry types are logged**, each by its own wrapper: `rn2` (749,484 in the
  public corpus), `rnd` (38,037), `d` (3,393), `rne` (1,062), `rnz` (707),
  `rnl` (155).
- **`rn1` is a macro**, `#define rn1(x, y) (rn2(x) + (y))`
  (`include/hack.h:1535`). It logs as its inner `rn2` and never as `rn1(...)`.
  There are zero `rn1` entries in the corpus, despite `docs/API.md` listing the
  format.
- **`d(n,x)` draws through `RND()` directly**, not through `rnd()`
  (`src/rnd.c:186`). So it logs exactly one entry and no inner ones:
  `d(11,8)=49 @ newmonhp(makemon.c:1042)` with nothing before it. A port that
  implements `d` as a loop over `rnd()` emits n bogus entries and desynchronises
  everything downstream. The skeleton did exactly this; fixed in M2.4.
- **`rnl(x)` also draws through `RND()` directly**, then makes a *real* `rn2`
  call for the Luck adjustment — but only when Luck is non-zero. So `rnl` usually
  logs one entry, and sometimes an `rn2` immediately before it.
- **Wrapper functions log after their inner calls.** The macros in the patch do
  not fire inside `rnd.c`, so inner calls inherit the outer caller's annotation
  and appear first. Observed for `rnz(350)`: `rn2(1000)`, `rn2(4)`, `rn2(4)`,
  `rne(4)=2`, `rn2(2)=1`, then `rnz(350)=1065` — all annotated
  `@ pleased(pray.c:1356)`.
- **Seeding** is 8 little-endian bytes of the seed (`src/rnd.c:43-58`).

## The display RNG context is not scored

`rn2_on_display_rng` (`src/rnd.c:70`) draws from `rnglist[DISP]`, a second
ISAAC64 context. Recorder patch 005 logs those calls with a `~d` prefix
(`~drn2(N) = M`), and only when a separate env var is set.

**There are zero `~d` entries in the public corpus**, and the scorer's
`isRngCall` predicate (`/^(?:rn2|rnd|rn1|rnl|rne|rnz|d)\(/`) would filter them
out anyway. So display draws never affect the RNG score.

They do affect *screens*, because hallucination picks glyphs through this stream
— `seed0383-wizard-hallucinate` and `seed0399-wizard-hallu-actions` are 751 steps
between them. Two things to know when M10.6 gets there:

- `rnglist[DISP]` has `init: FALSE` and is **never seeded**. It is a
  zero-initialised `isaac64_ctx` that is drawn from directly, so the display
  sequence is the same in every game regardless of seed.
- `js/isaac64.js` (frozen) exports no way to construct a zero-state context —
  `isaac64_init` takes seed bytes. Building the display context will need a
  zero-state equivalent assembled by hand.

## o_init.c is the first RNG consumer in every session

Measured across all 44 public sessions. **Every session's very first PRNG call
is `rn2(2) @ randomize_gem_colors(o_init.c:89)`.** Nothing in the stream precedes
it, so nothing downstream can align until `o_init` is right.

Exact call sites and volumes across the corpus:

```
10725  shuffle(o_init.c:129)          the bulk — description shuffling
   55  randomize_gem_colors:89/92/95  rn2(2), rn2(2), rn2(4), once per segment
   55  init_objects:234               objects[WAN_NOTHING].oc_dir = rn2(2) ? ...
```

(55 rather than 44 because the corpus has 56 segments, not 44.)

**`options.c` and `cfgfiles.c` never appear in any RNG log.** Option parsing
consumes zero randomness for these rc files, so the parser has no ordering
constraint against the stream. `role.c` does appear, in 21/44 sessions but only
42 calls total — random role/race selection when the rc does not pin them.

**The dependency this creates:** `shuffle()` walks `objects[]` and its draw count
depends on `oc_name_known` and the class ranges, so porting `o_init` requires the
object data table first. That table is `include/objects.h` — 1,659 lines, 361+
macro entries, the same generatable shape as `optlist.h`. Generate it, do not
transcribe it.

## Only two Lua scripts draw randomness

Refining the earlier Lua measurement. Across the corpus, 23,671 calls carry an
`@ nh.*` annotation, but only 1,512 also carry the richer
`src=<file>.lua:<line> parent=<fn>(<file>.lua:<line>)` form — and those name
just **two** files:

```
1402  nhlib.lua
 110  themerms.lua
```

So for *RNG parity* the Lua surface is two scripts, not 131. Other scripts still
have to execute to build levels correctly, but they do not draw. That materially
shrinks M9a's critical path.

The `src=`/`parent=` annotation gives the exact `.lua` file and line for each
draw, which is the Lua-side equivalent of the C caller annotation — use it the
same way `tools/diverge.mjs` uses the C one.

## Measured port priority

Top C files by how many sessions execute them, from `coverage-map.md`. All of
these appear in 44/44 sessions:

```
makemon.c 233,702 calls   mklev.c 131,517   sp_lev.c 97,479   mkobj.c 42,397
mon.c      26,200         mkmap.c  20,601   rect.c   17,966   allmain.c 12,743
mkroom.c   12,304         o_init.c 10,945   dungeon.c 6,186   eat.c      5,448
```

Hottest individual functions: `rndmonst_adj` (makemon.c, 204,394),
`mineralize` (mklev.c, 100,206), `distfleeck` (monmove.c, 33,817),
`create_room` (sp_lev.c, 32,170), `m_move` (monmove.c, 28,208).

**Caveat that matters:** this only sees code that draws random numbers. The tty
windowport, `botl.c`, and `objnam.c` are invisible here despite producing a large
share of the actual screen output. Do not read this as "port these and nothing
else".

## Baseline measurements

Taken 2026-07-24 against the untouched skeleton.

- `seed8000-tourist-starter`: C makes 3130 RNG calls, we make 3270. First
  divergence at call **3103**, in `m_move` (`src/monmove.c:1963`) — we draw
  `rn2(12)` where C draws `rn2(20)`. 3126 positions match by coincidence after
  it, which is exactly the overstatement described above.
- First screen miss is step **0**, the very first frame. The skeleton renders it
  **completely blank** — 227 of 1920 cells differ and every one is "C has a
  glyph, we have a space". The cursor, however, is already correct at `[36,7,1]`.
  So `fastforward.js` fakes RNG well enough to place a cursor and nothing else.
  This confirms the README: fake RNG credit produces no screens.
- Whole-corpus baseline: **0/11,405 screens**, 25,429/792,838 RNG positions
  (3.2%), 0/44 sessions passing. The 3.2% RNG figure is almost entirely
  coincidental alignment, not real progress.
- Public corpus: 44 sessions, 56 segments, 11,405 steps by our count (the README
  quotes 11,284 scored steps; the difference is steps with no recorded screen).
  792,838 annotated PRNG calls in total.
