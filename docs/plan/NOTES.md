# Working notes

Things discovered while doing the work that are not obvious from reading the
contest docs, and that would cost the next agent time to rediscover.

**Add to this file whenever you learn something non-obvious.** Edit the existing
entry if one covers the same ground rather than appending a duplicate. Keep each
entry short: what is true, how it was found, what to do about it.

## Scoring: what the runner actually does

Read from `frozen/ps_test_runner.mjs`, which is the same runner the judge uses.

**Cursor position is part of the screen score, not a tiebreaker.**
`docs/API.md` says cursors are "scored as a tiebreaker only". That is stale. The
runner counts a screen as matched only when the cell grid **and** the cursor both
agree (`ps_test_runner.mjs:371-377`), and `/README.md` agrees: "character + color
+ attribute + cursor position". A perfectly rendered screen with the cursor one
column off scores zero for that step. Port the cursor choreography, do not defer
it.

The runner does report `cellsOnly` and `cursors` sub-counts separately in its
JSON, and prints them on the FAIL line when they disagree — useful for triage.

**`runSegment` is called with one argument.** `docs/API.md` documents
`runSegment(input, prevGame = null)`, but the runner calls `runSegment(input)`
with no second argument (`ps_test_runner.mjs:337`). Do not rely on `prevGame`
carrying anything between segments. All cross-segment state must round-trip
through `input.storage`. This matters for every multi-segment session.

**RNG "matched" is a positional count, not a prefix length.** The runner counts
every index where our call equals C's (`ps_test_runner.mjs:357-359`). After a
divergence, later calls can coincidentally realign, so a high RNG percentage can
hide an early break. `tools/diverge.mjs` prints both the positional count and the
index of the first divergence — trust the first-divergence index.

**Per-session local timeout is 45 s**, from `SESSION_REPLAY_TIMEOUT_MS`
(`ps_test_runner.mjs:461`). The judge allows 900 s. So a session can pass the
judge's clock and still time out locally. Raise the env var rather than
optimising prematurely.

**The scorer writes `.cache/session-results.json`** with the full JSON bundle
after every run, so tooling can read the last score without re-running.

## The recorder

**`make install` does not install `sysconf`, and without it the recorder exits
before the first frame.**
The binary is built with `SYSCF` enabled (`include/config.h:232-234` defines
`SYSCF` and `SYSCF_FILE "sysconf"`), so `cfgfiles.c:2052` opens `sysconf`
relative to HACKDIR and calls `exit(EXIT_FAILURE)` if it is missing.
`SYSCONFINSTALL` is commented out in `sys/unix/Makefile.top:110-119` and no
minimal hints file defines it, so nothing ever creates the file.

The failure is silent in the worst way: `scripts/record-session.mjs` reports
`[ok] wrote …` and produces a session with the right number of segments and
**zero steps**. `scripts/verify-rerecord.mjs` then reports `FAIL: seg 0 steps len
N vs 0` for all 44 sessions, which reads like a recorder determinism problem
rather than a missing file.

Fixed permanently in `nethack-c/build-recorder.sh` (step 6). If you rebuild by
hand, the install dir needs a `sysconf`.

**The stock `sysconf` template breaks on macOS.** It sets
`GDBPATH=/usr/bin/gdb` and `GREPPATH=/bin/grep`; NetHack refuses to start when
those name files that do not exist, and prints `2 errors in sysconf.` as its
first screen. Strip `GDBPATH`, `GREPPATH`, `PANICTRACE_GDB`, and
`PANICTRACE_LIBC` — they only affect crash handling. The build script does this.

**Debug-mode sessions need `WIZARDS=*` in sysconf.** 13 of the 44 public
sessions set `playmode:debug` in their nethackrc. NetHack honours that only for a
user listed in the sysconf `WIZARDS` line; the stock template says
`WIZARDS=root games`, so an ordinary user is **silently demoted to normal play**.
There is no warning — you get a complete, valid, entirely different game, with
different attributes and a different level. The tell is the status line: a
debug-mode game shows the player name as `wizard` regardless of the rc `name:`,
so canonical `Wizard the Digger` re-recording as `Magellan the Digger` means the
demotion happened. The build script now writes `WIZARDS=*`.

**Debug mode forces the player name to `wizard`,** which means every debug-mode
segment shares one lock file (`<uid>wizard.0`) no matter what the characters are
named. Combined with the next entry, this is what broke the one remaining
multi-segment session.

**Abandoned in-progress games leak a lock into the next segment.** When a
segment's `moves` run out mid-death-sequence, the driver SIGTERMs the recorder
before NetHack unlinks its lock file, and the next segment opens on `There is
already a game in progress under your name. Destroy old game? [yn]` instead of
the recorded first frame — one step, then nothing.
`scripts/record-session.mjs` deliberately does not wipe state between segments
(a save/restore pair needs the save file), so this needed a narrower fix:
`clearAbandonedGame()` removes lock and per-level files (`*.<n>`) between
segments **only when `save/` is empty**, preserving bones, the scoreboard, and
genuine save/restore pairs. Hit by `seed5002-wizard-coverage-pair`.

**With all of the above, the recorder is bit-exact on the whole corpus:
`node scripts/verify-rerecord.mjs` reports 44/44 pass.** No normalisation is
needed for most sessions; `verify-rerecord.mjs` elides only the build-date
banner and the rc home path.

Recording is fast: a 23-step session re-records in well under a second, and all
44 sessions re-record in a couple of minutes.

## Session file format

`sessions/*.session.json`, version 5:

```
{ version, source, recorded_with, segments: [ { seed, datetime, nethackrc, moves, steps } ] }
```

Each step is `{ key, rng, screen, cursor }`, plus `depth` after the first and
`animation_frames` where animation fired. `key` is `null` on step 0 (the frame
before any input). `cursor` is `[col, row, visible]`.

RNG entries carry the caller annotation the scorer strips:

```
rn2(2)=0 @ randomize_gem_colors(o_init.c:89)
```

That annotation is the single most useful debugging asset in the repo — it names
the exact C source line that made each call. `tools/diverge.mjs` uses it to name
the next function to port.

Screens use `\n` line separators, `\x1b[NC` cursor-forward runs, SGR colour
escapes, and `\x0e`/`\x0f` to enter and leave DEC line-drawing mode.

The corpus is 51 MB across 44 files. Never read one whole; query with `node -e`.

## Baseline measurements

Taken 2026-07-24 against the untouched skeleton.

- `seed8000-tourist-starter`: C makes 3130 RNG calls, we make 3270. First
  divergence at call **3103**, in `m_move` (`src/monmove.c:1963`) — we draw
  `rn2(12)` where C draws `rn2(20)`. 3126 positions match by coincidence after
  it, which is exactly the overstatement described above.
- First screen miss is step **0**, the very first frame, cell grid differs. So
  the skeleton renders nothing that matches, despite `fastforward.js` faking the
  RNG prefix. This confirms the README: fake RNG credit does not produce screens.
- Public corpus: 44 sessions, 56 segments, 11,405 steps by our count (the README
  quotes 11,284 scored steps; the difference is steps with no recorded screen).
