// dothrow.js — throwing, firing, and the path a thrown thing takes.
// C ref: src/dothrow.c
//
// walk_path() is here first because several unrelated things need it: jump()
// walks the hero's leap through it, throwit() walks a missile, and the polearm
// code checks reach with it. It draws nothing at all — it is pure geometry —
// but every caller decides where something ENDS UP from its result, and a
// wrong endpoint moves the hero or an object without costing a single PRNG
// call, which is the kind of divergence the RNG log cannot show.

// src/dothrow.c:656 walk_path() — Bresenham from src to dest, calling
// check_proc at every step and stopping early when it returns false.
//
// On failure dest_cc is rewritten to the LAST square that passed, which is how
// callers learn where the path was blocked. C's comment notes the algorithm
// handles slanted moves suboptimally — a diagonal that clips a corner fails
// rather than routing around it — and that quirk is part of the behaviour.
