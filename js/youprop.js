// Same role js/monst.js plays for include/monst.h, js/obj.js for include/obj.h

// private copy per module.

// Hallucination arrived here because two modules wanted it and js/invent.js
// had it as a private `return false` stub. A stub is fine while nothing sets
// the property, but it goes on being quietly wrong after something does, and
// nothing catches that. Reading the real uprops entry costs the same and
// starts telling the truth by itself.

// Nothing here draws.
