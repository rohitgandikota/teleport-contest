/* ------------------------------------------------------------------------
   The three field readers every youprop.h macro is built from.

   C does not write u.uprops[X].intrinsic at each call site either; it
   defines a per-property macro trio and composes those:

       #define HHunger u.uprops[HUNGER].intrinsic
       #define EHunger u.uprops[HUNGER].extrinsic
       #define Hunger  (HHunger || EHunger)

   These are the generic form of that trio. They are ADDITIVE and unused so
   far: the 28 accessors above still read the VALUE, which is correct while
   uprops is undefined and WRONG the moment it becomes a struct, because an
   object is truthy.

   The atomic change described in docs/plan/STATUS.md is: rewrite each
   accessor in terms of H/E/B per its own C macro, add the three missing
   blocked terms (Invis, Levitation, Blinded), initialise uprops, and score.
   Until all of that lands together these three are just sitting here.
